## Intro

> Obligation: An obligation is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether legal or moral. -- Wikipedia

> Responsibility: a duty or task that you are required or expected to do. -- Merriam Webster

Normally, obligation and responsibility is the same thing. For example, parents have the obligation and responsibility to take care of their children. 
Everyone has obligation and responsibility to obey the law.
But I found there's still some difference between these two things. 

## Story

Here's my scenario. Four people rent a house together. 
Let's say they are A, B, C and D. They need to pay their rent monthly with a single check, mailing to the landlord. 
So they share the same obligation.

Someone has to stand up, collect money and eventually mail the check. 
There are a lot of ways to choose this person, but after chosen, this person has responsibility to get things done.

## Part 1

The best and easiest way to do this is cutting the obligation and responsibility into parts. 
For example, A pays January's rent. 
B pays February's rent. 
C pays March's rent and D pays April's rent. 
And the circle goes like this.

By doing this, obligation and responsibility are still a whole part. 
It's like when you cut a cake into four pieces, the bread and cream are still together in each part.

## Part 2

But what if this is not the case? 
What if someone volunteers to be the kindest guy and do the whole work? 
Let's assume A is the kindest guy. 
Now A gets the whole responsibility, while others still have the obligation.

This is good for most of the time. 
But what if something went wrong? For example, once A had problem with the check. 
He didn't have enough money in his account! 
So absolutely the check wouldn't be accepted and A, B, C, D should pay extra money for the returned check because they didn't pay the rent before the deadline.

Here's the problem: who should pay the penalty? 
I would say A. 
Because he's responsible for paying the rent and he made a mistake. 
So he should pay for his mistake.

But A would argue: I volunteered to do this extra job which I don't have full responsibility, why should I be fully responsible for it when it went wrong? 
It's unfair to me!

Yes, it's unfair to A not because he's responsible for his mistake. 
But it's unfair to him because A takes the whole responsibility of paying the rent in the first place without getting any benefit for it.

## Part 3

Now let's consider another case. 
Once A asked B to do the job for him because he's too busy and B agreed. 
Then B made the same mistake. 
Who should pay the penalty?

B! Because B took the responsibility for a short time and any damage caused during this time should be blamed for B.

## Part 4

In another case, A realized his mistake and asked B for help. 
B tried to help but it didn't work out. 
At last, who should pay for the penalty?

Still A! Because Although B has an obligation to pay the rent and help A to do it. 
He doesn't has responsibility even to help A. ( Think about this! ) He tried to help A just because he felt obligated. 
He surely should not be responsible for A's mistake.

## Rethinking

After revisiting my thoughts written a long time ago. I understand why I was thinking like that and mostly it's not wrong. 
But I ignored the very fact that people are far more complax than things. 
It's eazy to say it's right or wrong for doing this or that. 
But it might not be the case when applied to different persons.

Also, when we are making decisions, reazon or fact is not the only factor. 
Instead, we as human being are affected by emotions a lot. 
In many cases, the approach to deal with people is not to hold them for responsible for something, nor to blame them for not doing well.
What's the right way? It differs in each senario. But the basic idea is to understand and tolerant more.

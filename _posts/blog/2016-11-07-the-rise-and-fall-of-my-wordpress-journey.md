WordPress is an eazy use and widely adapted blogging tool. I used it for more than two years. I surely enjoyed the ride there. 
It's simple to set-up and manage. But as the technology develops as well as the demands changes, I'm planning to move my blog to a static site.

## My Opinions about WordPress

- eazy to use <-> require more efforts to customize
- eazy to manage contents <-> can't see much under the scene
- many advanced functions like logging, cache, anti-spam, etc <-> loading speed is not so well compared to static sites

## Ancient Age -- WordPress.com

> Three weeks has passed since I began to set up my own website. I used to write blog on some website like qq.com, but I found it’s not pleasing because it’s just like walking to other’s house to play games. What I want is a website of my own. Besides, it’s also important for a programmer like me to have a self website. So I decided to start setting up my own blog.

- Sign up in WordPress.com
- Follow the instruction
- Don’t buy two many stuff if you are not sure what they are used for

Done!

## Middle Age -- WordPress.org

- Buy a Domain (Provider example: GoDaddy.com)
- Buy a Web Server (Provider example: iPage.com)
  - There are three types of Web Server
    - Shared Server, least expensive
    - VPN Server, moderate expensive
    - Cloud Server, most expensive
  - Usually most Web Server providers offer domain purchase and vice vera
- Use a Web Builder to build your web (Provider example: WordPress.org) & Upload your website to the Web Server
  - In this step, I installed WordPress, following the instruction in <http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress>.
  - I referenced the “Easy 5 Minute WordPress Installation on Windows” & "Detailed Instructions".
  - Use a FTP client(e.g. FileZilla) to upload files to the server.
  
Done!

## Modan Age -- Gitpage

Web Hosting is cheap at the first 2-3 years, then the price jumps. Combined with the my lost of love for WordPress, 
I decided to use Gitpage and Jekyll for building my blog site for now. Maybe in the future I'll use a Cloud Server for web hosting.

During the migration, I lost the date and when I went back trying to move my contents from iPage, it's aleady gone. 
Without a backup, I was doomed. Then I came up with the idea of using Google Cache to restore my site.

Because Google scans and caches everything in the web. My site surely is still there somewhere in Google's server. 
Althrough only text is saved during cache, it's good enough for me to get back some old articles.

Thank you Google!

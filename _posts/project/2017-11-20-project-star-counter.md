As a software developer, there’s a lot of ways to measure his/her performance at work. But how to measure one’s achievement after work? I think this can be divided into three categories:

- Side Project
- Tech Blog
- Forum Activity

This web app get the following information and display with beautiful presentation:

- a user’s github likes
- a user’s tech blog likes
- a user’s stack overflow reputation
